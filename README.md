# COVID_19_rumor_detection
I am going to use the Twitter dataset, which is built by Cheng and Wang (Cheng, et al. 2021). They collected tweets about the pandemic with key hashtags as well as reply/retweet comments, and reply numbers. They manually labeled the stance, 
Sentiment: the veracity of each tweet by checking multiple sources. The datasets contain 2705 tweets. With the dataset, I tried to classify tweets by true and false after excluding tweets that were classified as unverified. I trained the classification models using the dataset. I used 80% of my dataset as training while another 20% as a test. I used the scikit-learn package in python and used Logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, 
LinearSVM, Decision tree, and XGBoost models.
